# kobayashi-maru
Python and Flutter implementation of Star Trek's [Kobayashi Maru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru) training exercise.

While the Kobayashi Maru exercise has been covered several times in Star Trek cannon, it [first appeared in The Original Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU1ah6MOorg). 
The linked video forms a useful reference for this project.

## Getting started
1. Run the [server](bridge_simulator/packages/python_server) on a laptop/desktop.
2. For each device that you want to use as a bridge station, run the [bridge_simulator](bridge_simulator) app and connect it to the server.
